What is enterprise resource planning? Yesterday and today.
In the past, businesses had some sort of accounting, finance, or HR process but the software systems they had often worked separately 
and didnâ€™t talk or work with one another. What makes modern ERP software different is that it brings all these different processes to
the table to collaborate and create one fluid system.

Current solutions also allow each department to see what the other is doing. The result is that accounting and HR can easily 
collaborate with sales and customer relationships.
